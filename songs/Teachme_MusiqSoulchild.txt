I was told the true definition of a man was to never cry
Work 'til you tired, got to provide
Always be the rock for my fam', protect them by all means
And give you the things that you need, baby

Our relationship is suffering
Trying to give you what I never had
You say I don't know to love you, baby
Well, I say show me the way

I keep my feelings deep inside I
Shadow them with my pride eye
I'm trying desperately, baby, just work with me

Teach me how to love
Show me the way to surrender my heart, girl, I'm so lost
Teach me how to love
How I can get my emotions involved, teach me

Show me how to love
Show me the way to surrender my heart, girl, I'm so lost
Teach me how to love
How I can get my emotions involved
Teach me how to love

I was always taught to be strong
Never let them think you care at all
Let no one get close to me before you and me
I den' shared things witchu girl about my past
That I'd never tell

To anyone else, no, just keep it to myself, yes
Girl, I know I lack affection and expressin' my feelings
It took me a minute to come and admit this but
See I'm really try'na change now
Wanna love you better, show me how
I'm tryin' desperately, baby hey

Ain't nobody ever took the time to try to teach me
What love was but you
And I ain't never trust no one enough
To let em tell me what to do

Teach me how to really show it
And show me how to really love you, baby
Teach me, please, just show me, yeah

'Cause I'm willing to let go of my fears
Girl, I'm serious about all that I've said
Girl, I wanna love you with all my heart
Baby, show me where to start
