Lately you've been questioning

If I still see you the same way
Cause through these trying years
We gonna both physically change
Now don't you know you'll always be
The most beautiful woman I know
So let me reassure you darlin' that
My feelings are truly unconditional
See I'll love you when
your hair turns gray, girl
I'll still want you if you

gain a little weight, yeah
The way I feel for you
will always be the same
Just as long as your
love don't change,
I was meant for you and you
were meant for me, yeah
And I'll make sure that I'll
be everything you need, yeah
Girl the way we are is how its gonna be
Just as long as your love don't change

Cause I'm not impressed, more or less

By them girls on the T.V and magazines
Cause honestly I believe
That your beauty
Is way more than skin deep
Cause everything about you makes me feel
I have the greatest gift in the world
And even when you get on my last nerve
I, couldn't see myself
being with another girl

I'll love you when

your hair turns gray, girl
I'll still want you if you
gain a little weight, yeah
The way I feel for you
will always be the same
Just as long as your

be everything you need, yeah
Girl the way we are is how its gonna be
Just as long as your love don't change

So don't waste your time worryin' bout

Small things that ain't relevant to me
Cause to my understanding
You're all I want and need
See what I'm tryin' to
say is I'm here to stay
And as long as your love
doesn't change, then
Baby darling I swear that I,
I swear I ain't going nowhere no.
