First things, first girl recognize
Who is with you now
Second thing, can't blame me for
How you were treated before I came

See I'm not Steven, Anthony Even, Leroy or Ivan
Damn girl, I've been right there for you
Since day one, so where is all this coming from?

See now, I'm not to blame for the pain
That was caused by previous cats, yeah
Who had your heart before me, girl no

I'm not to blame for the pain
That was caused by previous cats
You gotta see me for me

Now what is with all the questioning about
Where I've been and why must you roll your eyes
When I say she's just a friend, I knew before

Not like I call you Sabrina, Pam or Tanisha
Andrea either, girl, we go deeper than any other
I had before, so tell me why you ignore

See now, I'm not to blame for the pain
That was caused by previous cats
Who had your heart before me, baby

I'm not to blame for the pain
That was caused by previous cats
You gotta see me for me

Now I don't know what those young boys did
To make you insecure
But I think you need to let it go
Let it go

Don't let your past get all in the way
'Cause what is here today may not be guaranteed tomorrow
I'm not out of mind, just speaking my mind when I say
That I put in too much time for another's brother's crimes

Girl, I'm not to blame for the pain
That was caused by previous cats, yeah
Who had your heart before me, girl no

I'm not to blame for the pain
That was caused by previous cats
[Incomprehensible]

I'm not to blame for the pain
That was caused by previous cats
Previous

I'm not to blame for the pain
That was caused by previous cats
You gotta see me for me
