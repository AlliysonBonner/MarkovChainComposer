This project generates random text based on a given text corpus using a Markov chain algorithm. The program takes a directory of text files as input, and outputs a new composition based on the probabilities of each word following another.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/example-user/markov-chain-composer.git
cd markov-chain-composer
```
1. Add text files to the songs/ directory or use the existing files.
1. Run the program with the following command:
`python composer.py`
The program will generate a new composition of 300 words.
## Dependencies
* Python 3.x
* graph.py
## Acknowledgements
The implementation of the Markov chain algorithm is based on a tutorial by Kylie Ying.
